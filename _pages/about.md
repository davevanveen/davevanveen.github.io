I’m passionate about using data to solve important problems in areas such as healthcare, education, and social equity. My primary ambition is to guide emerging technology’s impact toward beneficial outcomes.

Currently I am a final-year PhD candidate in Stanford's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">John Pauly</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>.<br>
My research includes two major threads:
1. developing foundation models to improve healthcare outcomes 
2. designing machine learning (ML) algorithms for inverse problems in computational imaging and signal processing
