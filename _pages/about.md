I’m passionate about leveraging emerging technology to make healthcare more equitable, efficient, and patient-centric.

Currently I am a final-year PhD candidate in Stanford's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">John Pauly</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>.<br>
My research includes two major threads:
1. developing foundation models to improve healthcare outcomes 
2. designing machine learning (ML) algorithms for inverse problems in computational imaging and signal processing
